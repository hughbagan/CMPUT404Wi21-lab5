Question 1
----------
Static site generators are obviously great for serving static sites,
particularly sites that have a lot of structured (written) content
because then they can make use of templating.
Naturally, the big disadvantage is that you cannot have any dynamic
content that you usually have in a fully-fledged application; no 
scripting or javascript. (Unless you do something like JAMstack...)
