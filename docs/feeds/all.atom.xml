&lt;p&gt;"Save us, Lab Five!" I hear you plea. Well, don't worry, because I have a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Apply to work at Facebook. Grind leetcode (more on that one later). Get the interview. Pass it. Get the on-site interview. And when you go to the on-site interview, pack an EMP in your backpack. THEN, when your interviewer asks you to reverse fizzbuzz or whatever, you whip out your emp and say "reverse THIS!!!!" then you hit the button onn the EMP and delete Facebook!!! That's what happens when you BREAK UP WITH ME REBECCA YOU GET YOUR FACEBOOK DELETED!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is jamsnack? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically a bunch of frontend developers wanted to do backend stuff but didn't want to have to, &lt;em&gt;like, do any work or stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, I think static sites are cool too, but can we just keep it simple and in the database? That's what they are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole thing just seems like an exit scheme for Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll make my own new web framework paradigm. PeanutButterStack. Yeah, and it'll be way better than jam stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used LinkedIn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God it is awful. Badly designed and badly coded. It's effectively just another way for advertisers to make us insecure. The worst part? Some professionals actually take it seriously. I'll begrudgingly copy my resume to it, but there's no way on this side of the underworld that I will interact with people on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
