    <p>If the last 10 years have proved anything, it's that Mark Zuckerberg is a reptile and doesn't have human emotions. Through his devil's work that is Facebook he endeavours to rid the world of all positive emotions.</p>
<p>"Save us, Lab Five!" I hear you plea. Well, don't worry, because I have a solution.</p>
<p>Step 1: Apply to work at Facebook. Grind leetcode (more on that one later). Get the interview. Pass it. Get the on-site interview. And when you go to the on-site interview, pack an EMP in your backpack. THEN, when your interviewer asks you to reverse fizzbuzz or whatever, you whip out your emp and say "reverse THIS!!!!" then you hit the button onn the EMP and delete Facebook!!! That's what happens when you BREAK UP WITH ME REBECCA YOU GET YOUR FACEBOOK DELETED!!!!!!!!</p>
