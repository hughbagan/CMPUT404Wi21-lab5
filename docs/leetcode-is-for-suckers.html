    <p>(Ok so im writing this post on my Mom's ipad i stole it because she doesn't let me go on my computer past my bedtime.)</p>
<p>Leetcode is for suckers. What, you wanna work at Google or facebook or whatever? One problem with that: you actually have to go and live at the google place when you're an employee. You know how much of a dump san francisco is these days? Yeah, have fun with that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important puzzle piece: there's now a market catering to these kinds of people. Books, videos, articles-- whatever-- are being sold to you if you're a part of this crowd. Even if this is what you want to do, please PLEASE don't be a sucker and buy in to what the idiots on youtube say.</p>
<p>Here's a thought: instead of working at some esoteric company in a literal different country, try applying to the good companies in your area. I guarantee they need software developers too. </p>
<p>And stop stressing about it, that stuff takes years off your life you know.</p>
<p>And if you're an employer or recruiter reading this, just admit to yourself that you don't even know Kruskall's algorithm either. Your company isn't special.</p>
<p>Anyway yeah any job that you have to interview for &gt;6 months for is a scam.</p>
