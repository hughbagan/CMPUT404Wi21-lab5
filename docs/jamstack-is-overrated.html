    <p>Here's another trend that won't last the end of the year: JAMstack. </p>
<p>What is jamsnack? </p>
<p>Basically a bunch of frontend developers wanted to do backend stuff but didn't want to have to, <em>like, do any work or stuff.</em></p>
<p>Listen, I think static sites are cool too, but can we just keep it simple and in the database? That's what they are for.</p>
<p>This whole thing just seems like an exit scheme for Netlify.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll make my own new web framework paradigm. PeanutButterStack. Yeah, and it'll be way better than jam stack.</p>
<p>I'm hungry.</p>
