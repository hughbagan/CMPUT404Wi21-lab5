(Ok so im writing this post on my Mom's ipad i stole it because she doesn't let me go on my computer past my bedtime.)

Leetcode is for suckers. What, you wanna work at Google or facebook or whatever? One problem with that: you actually have to go and live at the google place when you're an employee. You know how much of a dump san francisco is these days? Yeah, have fun with that.

Perhaps the most important puzzle piece: there's now a market catering to these kinds of people. Books, videos, articles-- whatever-- are being sold to you if you're a part of this crowd. Even if this is what you want to do, please PLEASE don't be a sucker and buy in to what the idiots on youtube say.

Here's a thought: instead of working at some esoteric company in a literal different country, try applying to the good companies in your area. I guarantee they need software developers too. 

And stop stressing about it, that stuff takes years off your life you know.

And if you're an employer or recruiter reading this, just admit to yourself that you don't even know Kruskall's algorithm either. Your company isn't special.

Anyway yeah any job that you have to interview for >6 months for is a scam.
