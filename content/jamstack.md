Title: JAMstack is overrated

Here's another trend that won't last the end of the year: JAMstack. 

What is jamsnack? 

Basically a bunch of frontend developers wanted to do backend stuff but didn't want to have to, *like, do any work or stuff.*

Listen, I think static sites are cool too, but can we just keep it simple and in the database? That's what they are for.

This whole thing just seems like an exit scheme for Netlify.

Maybe I'll make my own new web framework paradigm. PeanutButterStack. Yeah, and it'll be way better than jam stack.

I'm hungry.
